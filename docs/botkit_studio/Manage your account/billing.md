## Overview

A measurement of your team's current usage can be found on your [account's billing page.](https://studio.botkit.ai/account/billing).

With a paid account, your usage meter will reset every month. If you are about to reach the limits for the term, your meter will indicate this and alert you that your account may need to be upgraded soon.

## Manage your subscription

#### Upgrading or Downgrading your account
If you have a valid credit card on file, Botkit Studio will automatically upgrade your team based on usage when you reach the upper thresholds of your current tier. Should you want to manage this manually, you can click on `Manage subscription` in your account and select the tier you would like to use going forward.

*Note: If you are _upgrading_ your account, Botkit Studio will do so immediately, and charge you the difference in price between your existing tier and the new one.* 

*If you are _downgrading_ your account, the new account account tier will take place at the _beginning_ of your next subscription period, and you be able to use the full range of existing tier benefits until then.*
