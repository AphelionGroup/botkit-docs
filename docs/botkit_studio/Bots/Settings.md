The settings page allows you to edit some global settings for your bot on one page. The following settings are currently available:

## Bot info
* `Name` - The friendly name of your bot.
*  `Description` - a short field you can use to describe a bot's purpose.
*  `Platform` - This setting will change the bot's script editor to match a specific platform and grant access to create platform specific content.

## Message console
The [message console](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/console) can also be managed here. Availble options:
* `Enable Console` - opt-in to sharing message content with Botkit Studio.
* `Retain console messages indefinitely` - Store messages beyond the default 30 day retention period.

## Fallback Behavior
You can set a [Fallback script](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/scripts) to trigger whenever a user messages a bot something they do not understand. Options are:
* `Do nothing` - This is the default behaviour.
*  `Run this script` - execute a script from your bot's script inventory.

## Platform Keys (Optional)
This allows you to save your Platform token directly in studio for reference.
