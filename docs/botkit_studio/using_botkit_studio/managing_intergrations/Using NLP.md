### Create a bot
To add a new bot to your team, click on `Create a Bot` from your [bot list page](https://studio.botkit.ai/app).


### Name the bot

This can be anything, but we suggest using a name that describes its function, and where it sits in your production pipeline.

### Describe what the bot will do
This field will describe the functions your bot is designed to use.


### Primary Platform
Choosing the default platform for your bot will create a editor UI that more closely matches the platform your bot will be ran in. This can help during the creation process to visualize the user experience before you have actually stood up the bot.
