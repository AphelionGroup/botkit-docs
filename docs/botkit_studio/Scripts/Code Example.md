Every [Bot](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/categories/bots-1) contains an inventory of Scripts, which are a set of skills your bot can use to work with humans. Whether you [create a new bot](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/create-your-bot) or are [managing an existing bot](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/manage-your-bots) you will see the following things when viewing the inventory:

## Search and creation functions

* `Filter Scripts` - If you have very many scripts, you can use this to thin the list to only items that match input. Checking `search entire script` will also search the contents of the script if you are having a hard time finding what you are looking for.
* `Create a script` - You can type the name of your script here. This is not displayed to end users, so feel free to use a descriptive name that will aid developers identifying the function of the script.
* `Describe what this script does` - This field can provide additional information on a given script's purpose
* `Create` - Clicking this button will instantly add a new script to your bot, pre-populated with some default responses. You can then start building out the function of the script using the [script editor](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/script-editor)

## Script inventory and actions
* `Script Name` - Developer indentifiable name for the script. Clicking on this name will take you directly to the [script editor](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/script-editor).
* `Description`- More contextual information that you can use to indicate a scripts function.
* `Actions` - Each script also has the following quick actions:
	* `Stats` - Jump directly to the [stats view](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/statistics-2) for a given script.
	* `Code Sample`- Generate code you can copy directly into your Botkit project.
	* `Delete`- Delete a script permanently. Be sure to edit any associated scripts before doing so.
