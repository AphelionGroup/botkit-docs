The Botkit Studio script editor allows you to design an entire library of bot interactions without requiring code pushes for updates. 

* `Script Info` - Information about your bot's purpose. This can be edited by clicking on the field, editing your information and then clicking save.
* * [`Triggers`](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/triggers) - Triggers are words used by users to initiate the script. One script can be triggered by any variety of words. 
* `Code Generator` - Include dynamic data, validate input, or build custom functionality.
* `Export` - Using this you can Download exported scripts, or copy the provided JSON into your own file.
* [`Threads`](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/script-threads) - Scripts can have several threads depending on user input. Choose between threads to view or change the messages in each one. 
* `The Message Window` - The message window allows you to view the flow of your script visually, and edit your botâ€™s dialogue directly.
* `Message Properties` - Clicking on a given message will show all text variations available for it, as well as any attachments associated with the message.
* [`Variables`](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/variables) - Variables are values that can change, depending on external conditions or on information passed on during the conversation with a user. You can enable variable collection in a message by checking `Capture user's typed response` in any message. This will create a step in the message window indicating the selected variable.
