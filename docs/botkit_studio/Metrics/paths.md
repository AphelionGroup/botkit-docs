The `Paths` metric view allow you to measure and compare the journey across various aspects of your conversation flow. At it's most basic, a path can be made up of two events:

* `Signed up` - When a user first accesses the bot.
* `Sent a message to the bot for the first time` - The first recorded message to the bot.

Once a [insight has been identified and saved](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/insights-3), you can add that as a potential event, creating detailed paths a user can potentially follow. This can be useful when diagnosing [Retention issues](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/retention), or just when you want to a/b test which scripts perform better than others.
