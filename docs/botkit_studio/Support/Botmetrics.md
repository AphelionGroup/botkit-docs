# Botmetrics FAQ

Botmetrics is [now a part of the Botkit Family!](https://blog.howdy.ai/botkit-botmetrics-acquisition-9295cb38e7e4). For current customers of Botmetrics, things will continue to operate as is for now. [The Botmetrics service](http://getbotmetrics.com/), as well as [the open source project](https://github.com/botmetrics/botmetrics), now live in Austin, Texas.
