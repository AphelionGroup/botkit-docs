### What do we support?
We provide email support for Botkit Studio customers on the [Business and Professional tiers](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/manage-your-billing-settings). For these users, we will respond during business hours to any email support request within 72 hours.

Our support is primarily designed for use of Studio features and management of your Botkit Studio teams, and not the design and implementation of your Botkit projects. 

If you have questions about using Botkit or about making a bot, we suggest searching and posting on our [public slack community](https://community.botkit.ai/) or post an issue in our [our Github repo](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-issues)
