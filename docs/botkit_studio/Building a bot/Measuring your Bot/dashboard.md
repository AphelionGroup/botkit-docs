The Dashboard view provides a top level view of the bots interactions. By default you will see the following reports:  

* `New Users`
* `Bots Installed`
* `Messages to Bot`
* `Messages from Bot`

Adding a `New Custom Dashboard` allows you to track any [arbitrary text or regex string](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/triggers) in this dashboard. Once added here you can then use it in your [Paths](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/paths) or [Users](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/users-8) views.
