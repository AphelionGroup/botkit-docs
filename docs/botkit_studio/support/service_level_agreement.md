Paid Botkit Studio teams can request a service credit as a result of any prolonged outage where we fail to meet the stated 99% uptime guarantee. SLA Credits are based on our monitoring, and may not exceed 10% of the total reoccuring fee in the month we failed to meet the service availability. 

### How to request a service credit
To apply for a Service Credit, the customer must submit a ticket via the Account Portal, or email help@botkit.ai within 30 days of the month in which the Unavailable Time occurred. The ticket must include (i) "SLA Claim" as the subject of the ticket; (ii) the dates and times of the Unavailable Time for which you are requesting credit; and (iii) any applicable information that documents the claimed outage.

This credit can be applied towards future Botkit Studio invoices, are forfeited at the expiration or termination of your Botkit Studio subscription, and will not be paid in cash.
